MLT FRAMEWORK EXTRA MODULES README
----------------------------------

	Written by Rafal Lalik <rafallalik@gmail.com>

	MLT is a LGPL multimedia framework designed for television broadcasting,
	and melted is a GPL multi-unit video playout server with realtime
	effects.

	This package provides extra modules written by myself.

	This document provides a quick reference for the minimal configuration,
	build and installation of MLT Extra Modules. 


Configuration
-------------

	Configuration is triggered by running:

	    ./configure 

	More information on usage is found by running:

	    ./configure --help

	NB: This script must be run to register new services after a CVS checkout
	or subsequent update.


Compilation
-----------

	Once configured, it should be sufficient to run:

	    make

	to compile the system.


Testing
-------

	To execute the mlt tools without installation, or to test a new version
	on a system with an already installed mlt version, you should run:

	    . setenv

	NB: This applies to your current shell only and it assumes a bash or 
	regular bourne shell is in use.


Installation
------------

	The install is triggered by running:
	
	    make install 
	

More Information

	For more detailed information, please refer to docs/install.txt.
