MLT FRAMEWORK EXTRA MODULES README
----------------------------------

    Written by Rafal Lalik <rafallalik@gmail.com>

    MLT is a LGPL multimedia framework designed for television broadcasting,
    and melted is a GPL multi-unit video playout server with realtime
    effects.

    This package provides extra modules written by myself.

    This document provides a quick reference for the minimal configuration,
    build and installation of MLT Extra Modules.

Prerequisities
--------------

    This README recommends different installation procedure than in previous
    version. If you already installed this package from sources, and you kept
    the build tree, I recommend to call `make uninstall` or
    `sudo make uninstall` to remove the installed files from previous location.
    The new recommended method might install files into different locations.
    If you didn't keep your build tree, the standard procedure most likely
    installed files into /usr/local. Inspect the directories for files related
    to this install:
        {lib,lib64}/libmltrl.so
        {lib,lib64}/pkgconfig/mlt-extra_modules.pc
        share/mlt/rl/filter_typewriter.yml
    and remove them

Configuration
-------------

    Configuration is triggered by running:

        ./configure --prefix=$(pkg-config mlt-framework --variable=prefix) \
                    --libdir=$(pkg-config mlt-framework --variable=libdir)

    More information on usage is found by running:

        ./configure --help

    To install the kdenlive effect file add option:

        --kdenlive-effects=directory

    where `directory` is a path to kdenlive effects dir. Typical location on
    your system might looks like `/usr/share/kdenlive/effects`.

Compilation
-----------

    Once configured, it should be sufficient to run:

        make

    to compile the system.


Installation
------------

    The install is triggered by running:

        make install

    or

        sudo make install

    if installed into system location from a user account.
